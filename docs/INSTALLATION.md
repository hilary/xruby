## Installation

Ruby-lang provides a nice [guide to installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). If you need a bit more help, you might also consult the [installation guide at Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/environment/environment.html).

You will need to install the Minitest gem:

```bash
$ gem install minitest
```
